Knapsack problems appear in real-world decision-making processes in a wide variety of fields, such as finding the least wasteful way to cut raw materials,
selection of investments and portfolios, selection of assets for asset-backed securitization, and generating keys for the Merkleâ€“Hellman and 
other knapsack cryptosystems.
