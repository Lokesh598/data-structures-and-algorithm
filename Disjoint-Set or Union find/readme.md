A disjoint-set data structure also called a union–find data structure or merge–find set, is a data structure that stores a collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets. Equivalently, it stores a partition of a set into disjoint subsets. It provides operations for adding new sets, merging sets (replacing them by their union), and finding a representative member of a set. It implements two useful operations:

Find: Determine which subset a particular element is in. This can be used to determine if two elements are in the same subset.
Union: Join two subsets into a single subset.
