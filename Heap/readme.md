# Heap
  A heap is a special tree-based data structure in which the tree is the complete binary tree.
  
  ## What is Complete Binary Tree or Almost Complete Binary Tree??
     So first we have to know what is Binary Tree.
     
  ### What is Binary Tree??
      
      Binary Tree Representation:
                  1. Array
                  2. Linked List

      Doubly Linked list one of the application of Binary Tree.
  
 # Heap Tree
       1. Max Heap Tree 
       2. Min Heap Tree

       1. Max Heap Tree
          In the given ACBT or CBT at every node root is maximum or equal comparing its children then it is Max Heap Tree.
     
       2. Min Heap Tree
          In the give ACBT or CBT at every node root is minimum or equal comparing its children then it is Min Heap Tree.
